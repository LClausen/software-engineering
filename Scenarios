Scenario 01

INITIAL ASSUMPTION
Member1 wants to start a voice-and-video-call to Member2 on his contact-list.

NORMAL
He sends a request to the other user. The other User accepts the request. The System builds a P2P
connection between those Users. Data is exchanged via that connection. A video-chat-window and tab opens 
on both Members platforms.


WHAT CAN GO WRONG

//too many tabs opened??//

The request is not sent/not received
  Give feedback to Member1 (such as timeout)
  
The Member1 is blocked by Member2.
  Give feedback to Member1 ("Member2 blocked you")
  
The connection collapses
  Give feedback to Member1 and Member2 (connection timeout)

OTHER ACTIVITIES
There may not be more than one video-call to a single Member at the same time. 

SYSTEM STATE ON COMPLETION
The data-stream is stopped. The video-chat-windows and tabs close on both Members platforms. The connection is cut (cancelled).


1: Phone-call between two Members
2: Chat between two Users
3: Gruop conference + chat + whiteboard
4: Hold a lecture (open gruop chat, only one person talking on video)
5: Share a Document
6: Share Screen
