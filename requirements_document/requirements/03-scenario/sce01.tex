\section{Scenario for collecting medical history}
\begin{description}
  \item [INITIAL ASSUMPTION:]
    \textit{The patient has seen a medical receptionist who has created a record in the 
    system and collected the patient’s personal information (name, address, age,
    etc.). A nurse is logged on to the system and is collecting medical history.}
  \item [NORMAL:]
    \textit{The nurse searches for the patient by family name. If there is more than
    one patient with the same surname, the given name (first name in English)
    and date of birth are used to identify the patient. \newline
    The nurse chooses the menu option to add medical history.  \newline
    The nurse then follows a series of prompts from the system to enter
    information about consultations elsewhere on mental health problems (free
    text input), existing medical conditions (nurse selects conditions from
    menu), medication currently taken (selected from menu), allergies (free
    text), and home life (form).}
  \item [WHAT CAN GO WRONG:]
    \textit{The patient’s record does not exist or cannot be found. The nurse should
    create a new record and record personal information. \newline
    Patient conditions or medication are not entered in the menu. The nurse
    should choose the ‘other’ option and enter free text describing the
    condition/medication. \newline
    Patient cannot/will not provide information on medical history. The nurse
    should enter free text recording the patient’s inability/unwillingness to
    provide information. The system should print the standard exclusion form   
    stating that the lack of information may mean that treatment will be
    limited or delayed. This should be signed and handed to the patient.}
  \item [OTHER ACTIVITIES:]
    \textit{Record may be consulted but not edited by other staff while information is
    being entered.}
  \item [SYSTEM STATE ON COMPLETION:]
    \textit{User is logged on. The patient record including medical history is entered
    in the database.}
